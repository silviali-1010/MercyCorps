Capture and communicate where climate and conflict shocks are likely to have the largest, unmitigated impacts on humanitarian needs in the coming years by conducting cross-country and quantitative analysis.

With over 110 million people displaced and 260 million facing acute food insecurity across the globe, the importance of humanitarian need is undeniable. Despite this level of need, most humanitarian appeals are underfunded. Consequently, donors and organizations that respond to humanitarian needs are exploring ways to either better prepare for crises or prevent them altogether. To this end, Mercy Corps, an international humanitarian and development agency, would like to understand how existing, cross-national indices perform in predicting humanitarian need.

To answer this question, the Harris School Policy Lab team explored how the Fragile State Index (FSI), INFORM Climate Change Risk Index, ND-GAIN Country Index, and World Risk Index (WRI) predict people in need across time. I was responsible to conduct econometrics analysis for FSI dataset. 

We tested 3 different econometric models with various time lags. We found that the overall scores from ND-GAIN and FSI best predict people in need. In addition, the ND-GAIN readiness sub-indicators performed best in predicting people in need. Based on these results, we recommend Mercy Corps track the previous year’s ND-GAIN readiness indicators using a panel model with fixed effects to help guide its policy and programmatic decisions related to reducing risk and strengthening resilience.
